# CookSomeHooks 🧑‍🍳🪝

## Project Description

CookSomeHooks is a DeFi project developed during the ETHGlobal Brussels hackathon. Our project simplifies the creation of hooks in Uniswap v4 with the help of generative AI, making it easier for developers to implement custom logic in their liquidity pools.

## Short Description

CookSomeHooks: AI-powered Uniswap v4 hook creation for smarter, more efficient DeFi protocols!

## How it's Made

We built CookSomeHooks using a powerful combination of technologies:

1. **Solidity**: For writing secure and efficient smart contracts, particularly Uniswap v4 hooks.
2. **Foundry**: For testing and deploying our smart contracts.
3. **Hardhat**: For additional development environment capabilities and contract verification.
4. **TypeScript**: For developing a type-safe frontend and backend.
5. **React**: For building our user interface.
6. **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and optimized React applications.
7. **WalletConnect**: For seamless wallet integration and connection.
8. **Wagmi**: For React hooks for Ethereum.
9. **Ethereum Name Service (ENS)**: For human-readable Ethereum addresses.
10. **Uniswap v4 Hooks Contracts**: As the foundation for our custom hook implementation.
11. **Worldcoin ID Verification**: For secure and private user verification.

Our project leverages the power of generative AI to assist in creating Uniswap v4 hooks. By analyzing the developer's requirements and the Uniswap v4 documentation, our AI suggests optimal hook implementations, making it easier for developers to customize their liquidity pools.

The frontend, built with Next.js and React, provides an intuitive interface for developers to input their requirements and receive AI-generated hook suggestions. We use WalletConnect and Wagmi for seamless wallet integration and interaction with the EVM compatible blockchain.

On the backend, we use a combination of Hardhat and Foundry for a robust development environment, allowing for easy testing, deployment, and verification of the generated hooks.
